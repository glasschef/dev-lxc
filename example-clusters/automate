# memory_per_server sets the maximum amount of user memory (including file cache) for each server.
# dev-lxc will set the `memory.limit_in_bytes` cgroup for each server to apply this limit.
# If no units are specified, the value is interpreted as bytes.
# You can use suffixes to represent larger units - k or K for kilobytes, m or M for megabytes, and g or G for gigabytes.
# The default behavior is that no limit is set.
